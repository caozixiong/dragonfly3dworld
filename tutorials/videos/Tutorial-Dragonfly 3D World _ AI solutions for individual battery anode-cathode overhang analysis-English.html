            <h2>Tutorial Content</h2>
            <h1>Battery Cell Analysis in Dragonfly Software</h1>
<h2>Introduction [00:00:05]</h2>
<p>This tutorial demonstrates how to perform analysis of battery cells using Dragonfly software. You'll learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perform manual measurements easily</li>
<li>Conduct typical inspection of cylindrical battery cells</li>
<li>Use automation tools with deep learning</li>
<li>Train your own model for battery analysis</li>
</ul>
<h2>Understanding the Data [00:02:45]</h2>
<p>The data shows a cylindrical battery cell with anodes and cathodes rolled up adjacent to each other, surrounded by a metal casing. The cross-sectional views provide the best perspective for making measurements.</p>
<p>In the 2D cross-sectional view, we can see:<br />
- Cathode materials<br />
- Anode materials<br />
- Spacer materials between them</p>
<p>The scan comes from a reasonably fast scan on a Comet Exelon FF35 system. This demo case shows how scanning and analysis of cells can be fully automated.</p>
<h2>Manual Inspection for Defects [00:04:36]</h2>
<p>When inspecting battery cells, you need to look for:<br />
- Inclusions which shouldn't be there<br />
- Areas out of specification<br />
- Broken pieces or defects</p>
<p>To better visualize defects, adjust the contrast:<br />
1. Click on the data view<br />
2. Use the window leveling option to change the contrast of the image</p>
<h3>Using Cylindrical Cross-Section View</h3>
<p>The cylindrical cross-section view allows you to examine the battery at different angles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn around the object to get cross-sections at different angles</li>
<li>When you find an interesting feature, place the crosshair at that point</li>
<li>Examine the feature in other views to confirm the defect</li>
</ol>
<h3>Adding Annotations [00:06:02]</h3>
<p>To mark defects for later reference:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <code>Annotate</code> option</li>
<li>Choose <code>Points</code></li>
<li>Hold down Control and click in the window to create a point</li>
<li>The annotation will show the X, Y, Z location of the defect</li>
</ol>
<p>To navigate between annotations:<br />
1. Right-click on an annotation in the list<br />
2. Select <code>Center View</code> to focus on that point in all views</p>
<p>You can export annotations to a CSV file:<br />
1. Select all annotations (click first, then Shift+click last)<br />
2. Right-click and select <code>Export to file</code><br />
3. Save as a CSV file</p>
<h2>Manual Measurements [00:09:52]</h2>
<p>To manually measure overhang heights:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the <code>Ruler</code> tool from the annotation panel</li>
<li>Click to place the start and end points of your measurement</li>
<li>Adjust measurements by selecting and moving the endpoints</li>
<li>Use the <code>Nearest Interpolation</code> mode to see actual pixels for more precise measurements</li>
<li>Use the <code>Floating Caption</code> option to position measurement labels more clearly</li>
</ol>
<p>To save your measurements:<br />
1. Right-click on the image and export a screenshot<br />
2. Select all rulers and right-click to export data to a CSV file</p>
<h2>Automated Analysis with Deep Learning [00:13:02]</h2>
<p>Manual measurements can be time-consuming when analyzing multiple cells. Deep learning models can speed up the process by automatically segmenting the regions of interest.</p>
<h3>Using a Pre-trained Model [00:14:40]</h3>
<ol>
<li>In the segmentation panel, select <code>Segment with AI</code></li>
<li>Choose your trained model</li>
<li>Use the <code>Preview</code> option to segment only the current slice</li>
<li>The result will show different classes (e.g., cathodes, background, anode overhang)</li>
<li>Right-click on the result and export the class of interest as an ROI</li>
</ol>
<p>To analyze the segmentation:<br />
1. Right-click on the exported ROI and select <code>Compute Measurements</code><br />
2. Choose appropriate measurements (e.g., 2D major axis length for overhangs)<br />
3. View the results with color mapping to visualize differences in measurements</p>
<h2>Training Your Own Deep Learning Model [00:17:10]</h2>
<p>The Segmentation Wizard in Dragonfly allows you to train models without being an AI expert.</p>
<h3>Setting Up a Training Session [00:19:19]</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click on <code>AI Segmentation Wizard</code> and select <code>New</code></li>
<li>Choose whether to start with a pre-trained model or from scratch</li>
<li>Add your first frame by clicking the plus button</li>
<li>Define your classes (e.g., background and anodes)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Creating Training Data [00:20:14]</h3>
<p>For each class:<br />
1. Select the appropriate brush tool (e.g., 2D brush or local Otsu brush)<br />
2. Paint examples of each class in your frame<br />
3. Add more frames from different regions of your sample<br />
4. Set one frame as a monitoring frame to track progress during training</p>
<h3>Training the Model [00:21:45]</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click <code>Start Training</code></li>
<li>Choose a model type or use a pre-trained model as a starting point</li>
<li>Monitor the training progress</li>
<li>Training can take from 20 minutes to several hours depending on your data and computer</li>
</ol>
<h3>Saving Your Model [00:36:37]</h3>
<p>When training is complete:<br />
1. Go to the model tab and click the save button to publish it to your system<br />
2. Or exit and choose to publish the model with a custom name</p>
<h2>Conclusion [00:37:09]</h2>
<p>Dragonfly software provides powerful tools for battery cell analysis, from manual inspection and measurements to automated deep learning approaches. While manual methods provide precision and control, deep learning models can significantly speed up your workflow once properly trained. This combination of techniques allows for comprehensive analysis of battery cells for research and quality control purposes.</p>
