            <h2>Tutorial Content</h2>
            <h2>Introduction to Battery Overhang Segmentation [00:00:03]</h2>
<p>This tutorial demonstrates how to segment battery overhang regions using Segmentation Wizard, a deep learning-based approach. Rather than showing each step in real-time, this tutorial explains the process and showcases the results on already processed data.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Challenge [00:00:42]</h2>
<p>The region of interest in this tutorial is the battery overhang. Traditionally, engineers would use linear measurements with a ruler to measure these regions.</p>
<p>When making linear measurements:<br />
- Measurements do not snap to voxels - they are subvoxel measurements<br />
- Text from multiple measurements may overlap<br />
- Use the floating caption feature to organize multiple linear measurements cleanly</p>
<p>While linear measurements work, they are limited. Ideally, we want to segment out the entire overhang regions.</p>
<h2>Limitations of Traditional Thresholding [00:02:39]</h2>
<p>Traditional thresholding methods have significant limitations when trying to segment battery overhangs:<br />
- Adjusting threshold ranges produces inconsistent results<br />
- Some areas are missed while unrelated areas are captured<br />
- The segmentation appears messy across multiple slices<br />
- Finding an optimal threshold range is extremely difficult</p>
<p>This is precisely why deep learning provides a better solution for this type of segmentation.</p>
<h2>Deep Learning Approach with Segmentation Wizard [00:03:21]</h2>
<p>Deep learning works well for this application because it uses image recognition techniques. For better results:<br />
- Crop the dataset to focus only on the area of interest<br />
- This helps the model converge to a good solution more easily<br />
- The final result cleanly segments the overhang regions</p>
<h2>Applying a Trained Model [00:04:15]</h2>
<p>Once you have trained a model, applying it is straightforward:<br />
1. Select your segmentation model (in this case "battery over")<br />
2. Choose a slice to analyze<br />
3. Click on <code>Preview</code> to apply the model to that slice</p>
<p>The key advantages of this approach:<br />
- No human bias or manual thresholding involved<br />
- Simply apply your previously trained model to all slices<br />
- The same model can be used on multiple similar battery scans<br />
- Results can be used for thickness analysis and overhang analysis</p>
<h2>Training with Segmentation Wizard [00:05:30]</h2>
<p>To access Segmentation Wizard:<br />
1. Navigate to <code>Artificial Intelligence</code> &gt; <code>Segmentation Wizard</code></p>
<p>The training process involves:<br />
- Creating training frames by painting the regions of interest<br />
- Using the smart grid tool for 2D segmentation<br />
- Fixing areas with the paint tool where needed<br />
- Using a unit attention model for training</p>
<p>You don't need to create all training frames at once:<br />
1. Start with one frame and train initially<br />
2. Add new frames as needed<br />
3. Use your existing model to pre-segment new training frames<br />
4. Fix up the edges or problem areas<br />
5. Retrain to strengthen your model</p>
<p>Before finishing, remember to save your model with a recognizable name so you can apply it later. Training a model is separate from applying it to your entire dataset.</p>
<h2>Conclusion [00:08:19]</h2>
<p>This deep learning approach to battery overhang segmentation offers significant advantages over traditional methods. By training a custom model with Segmentation Wizard, you can achieve consistent, accurate results without the limitations of threshold-based techniques. The same model can be applied to multiple similar scans, making it an efficient solution for battery analysis workflows.</p>
