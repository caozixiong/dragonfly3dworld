        <h1>A Natural History Perspective: Micro-CT Scanning at the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology - (English)</h1>
        <p>This presentation explores how micro-CT scanning technology is revolutionizing natural history museum collections at the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, allowing researchers to non-destructively study internal morphology of specimens while preserving them for future generations and enhancing scientific research and public engagement.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Tutorial Content</h2>
            <h2>Introduction to Natural History Museums and CT Scanning [00:01:08]</h2>
<p>Natural history museums are scientific institutions that record Earth's biodiversity and its history. They accomplish this through the creation and curation of scientific collections of specimens from around the world. These vouchered specimens are used for research and public engagement.</p>
<p>Museums serve several important purposes:<br />
- Act as time capsules for biodiversity, allowing comparison of specimens collected from the same locality over time<br />
- Provide resources for morphological and molecular data used in taxonomic, phylogenetic, and biomechanical studies<br />
- Help identify biodiversity hotspots and cold spots around the world<br />
- Serve as many people's first contact with the natural world, creating moments of awe and inspiration</p>
<p>The primary goals of natural history museums are:<br />
- Long-term preservation of vouchered specimens<br />
- Ensuring collections are available for research and education</p>
<h2>CT Scanning in Natural History Museums [00:04:20]</h2>
<p>CT scanning fits perfectly with the overarching goals of natural history museums for several key reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-destructive nature</strong>: CT scanning allows collection of morphological data without cutting, dissecting, or skeletonizing specimens</li>
<li><strong>Data-rich resource</strong>: Provides comprehensive information about specimens</li>
<li><strong>Contributes to "super specimens"</strong>: When combined with geographical, behavioral, and molecular data, CT scans help create complete specimen records</li>
<li><strong>Public outreach</strong>: CT data can be transformed into engaging educational materials like 3D prints</li>
<li><strong>Future-proof data collection</strong>: Preserves information about specimens for future research applications that cannot be predicted today</li>
</ul>
<h2>The University of Michigan Museum of Zoology (UMMZ) [00:07:20]</h2>
<p>The UMMZ is one of the largest collections on Earth:<br />
- Largest university herpetological collection globally<br />
- Houses millions of specimens across taxonomic groups</p>
<p>A unique advantage of the UMMZ is that the micro-CT scanner is less than 50 feet away from the collections, making specimen scanning highly accessible. Since 2018, the facility has:<br />
- Conducted over 7,000 specimen scans<br />
- Scanned approximately 5,500 species from their collection<br />
- Accumulated around 100 terabytes of data<br />
- Performed 12-15 specimen scans on an average day</p>
<p>Notable scanning achievements include:<br />
- Largest specimen: a red fox<br />
- Smallest specimen: a barb from a cone snail<br />
- Specialized scanning of a wasp using virtual floor techniques</p>
<h2>Scanning Process and Resources [00:09:50]</h2>
<p>When scanning specimens, careful protocols are followed to protect them:<br />
- Fluid-preserved specimens are packed in heat-sealed bags to prevent desiccation<br />
- Most scans are about 15 minutes long</p>
<p>The UMMZ provides resources for students, including:<br />
- Training in scanner operation<br />
- Instruction in Dragonfly and other segmentation software<br />
- Access to programs like Blender for producing 3D prints<br />
- Support for research projects that can lead to publications</p>
<p>The facility has also specialized in DICE CT (diffusible iodine contrast-enhanced CT):<br />
- Staining specimens to increase density of soft tissue structures<br />
- Visualizing musculature and neural anatomy<br />
- Developing protocols that minimize impact on specimens<br />
- Sharing improved processes with the scientific community</p>
<h2>Data Management and Sharing [00:12:37]</h2>
<p>The UMMZ is committed to transparent data sharing:<br />
- Data is available on MorphoSource (a repository run by Duke University)<br />
- Working on their own repository called Deep Blue Data<br />
- Linking CT data sets back to their specimen catalog</p>
<p>The museum participated in the Overt project, an NSF-funded multi-institutional scanning effort that:<br />
- Aimed to CT scan representative species of all extant vertebrate taxa<br />
- Completed approximately 22,000 species<br />
- Made all data available on MorphoSource</p>
<h2>Research Applications [00:15:21]</h2>
<p>CT scanning at UMMZ supports numerous research projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Snake neural anatomy</strong>: Examining how neurology has changed across the snake evolutionary tree</li>
<li><strong>Venom delivery systems</strong>: Studying the morphology of venom glands and correlating with protein sequences</li>
<li><strong>Bat cardiopulmonary systems</strong>: Analyzing the heart and lung structures of different bat species</li>
<li><strong>Ecological insights</strong>: Discovering prey items in specimens without dissection (like finding a frog inside a snake)</li>
<li><strong>Reproductive biology</strong>: Examining developing young in live-bearing species</li>
<li><strong>Fish anatomy</strong>: Investigating neural anatomy, swim bladder structure, and jaw morphology</li>
</ul>
<h2>Core Facility Services [00:18:14]</h2>
<p>The UMMZ now operates as a core facility, offering CT scanning services to researchers. When scanning UMMZ specimens:<br />
- CT data is treated as a facsimile of the actual specimen<br />
- Users must agree to make data available on Deep Blue Data or another repository<br />
- Data can be held until after publication<br />
- The facility provides free data storage and DOI assignment for publications</p>
<h2>Conclusion [00:19:19]</h2>
<p>CT data and natural history museums complement each other perfectly:<br />
- CT scanning provides wealth of morphological and anatomical information without destroying specimens<br />
- Creates comprehensive "super specimen" records with multiple data types<br />
- Facilitates data sharing through repositories<br />
- Serves as an excellent training tool for students learning comparative anatomy<br />
- Provides engaging resources for public outreach and education</p>
<p>The integration of CT scanning into museum practices enhances both preservation and research capabilities while making collections more accessible to scientists and the public alike.</p>
