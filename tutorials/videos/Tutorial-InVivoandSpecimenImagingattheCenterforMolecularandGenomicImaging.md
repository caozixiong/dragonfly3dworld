## I. In Vivo Imaging of COVID-19 in Mice [00:08:45-00:18:00]

### Research Objective

The study aims to establish an in vivo model for Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as long COVID, using genetically modified mice.

### Key Components

- **Animal Model** [00:08:45]
    - Novel genetically modified mice with humanized ACE2, TMPRSS2, and furin genes
    - These modifications make the mice susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection
- **Imaging Methodology** [00:11:19]
    - Respiratory-gated micro-CT for lung imaging
    - Allows for precise imaging synchronized with the mice's breathing cycle
- **Image Analysis Approach** [00:13:46]
    - Deep learning model using 3D Unet architecture for automated lung segmentation
    - Data augmentation techniques implemented to improve model performance
    - Image mask size carefully specified for optimal results [00:13:53]
    - Six training sets used at both end-expiration and inspiration phases [00:14:11]

### Research Findings [00:16:28]

- Initial results show decreased lung volume in infected animals at day five post-infection
- This approach enables non-invasive monitoring of disease progression

## II. Specimen Imaging of Orchid Bee Brains [00:19:13-00:24:00]

### Research Objective

The study investigates sexual dimorphism in neotropical orchid bee brains to understand behavioral differences between males and females.

### Key Components

- **Research Focus** [00:19:13]
    - Examining anatomical differences in bee brains
    - Understanding how brain structure relates to behavioral diversity between sexes
- **Imaging Techniques** [00:20:41]
    - Micro-CT imaging with iodine and ethanol staining
    - Special contrast enhancement methods to visualize soft tissue
- **Analysis Method** [00:20:57]
    - Manual segmentation of nine distinct brain regions
    - Detailed volumetric comparison between male and female specimens

### Research Findings

- **Male Bees** [00:23:21]
    - Show enlargement in brain regions related to visual processing
    - These adaptations likely support their mate-seeking behaviors
- **Female Bees** [00:23:37]
    - Exhibit enlargement in brain regions associated with learning and memory
    - These adaptations support their foraging and nesting activities

The presentation demonstrates how advanced micro-CT imaging techniques, combined with sophisticated analysis methods, enable researchers to investigate both disease models and fundamental biological questions about brain structure and function.
