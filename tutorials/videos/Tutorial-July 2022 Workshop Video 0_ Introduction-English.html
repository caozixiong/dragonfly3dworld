        <h1>July 2022 Workshop Video 0: Introduction - (English)</h1>
        <p>This video introduces a series of tutorials on Dragonfly software, a powerful image analysis tool that's free for academic use, based on a recent workshop held at CNRS in Grenoble, France, covering basic functionality through advanced features like deep learning segmentation.</p>

            <h2>Tutorial Content</h2>
            <h1>Introduction to Dragonfly Software</h1>
<h2>Welcome and Context [00:00:03]</h2>
<p>Welcome to this recording, the first in a series of videos based on a recent Dragonfly workshop held at CNRS in Grenoble, France. Instead of sharing a nine-hour workshop video, we've decided to streamline the content into smaller, more focused video sections. Each video in the series will have a clear description on YouTube, making it useful for both new and advanced users.</p>
<p>Dragonfly is a powerful and comprehensive software package. While the focus of these videos is to help new users accomplish useful tasks with specific examples, even advanced users may find valuable information.</p>
<p>For more content to help you learn the software, follow our channels:<br />
- Twitter<br />
- LinkedIn<br />
- YouTube<br />
- Website: theobjects.com</p>
<p>The Objects is the company behind the Dragonfly software and has been owned by the Comet Group, a global technology company, for about one and a half years.</p>
<h2>About Dragonfly Software [00:03:37]</h2>
<p>Dragonfly is an image analysis software package designed for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visualization of images from microscopy and tomography tools</li>
<li>Measurement and inspection in 2D, 3D, and 4D (time series data)</li>
<li>Image processing and segmentation</li>
<li>Deep learning tools for segmentation with limited data</li>
<li>Quantitative analysis</li>
<li>Animations and reporting</li>
<li>Data analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>The software is <strong>free for non-commercial use</strong>, making it particularly valuable for academics. The academic license is not a limited version but the full software, identical to the commercial license. This approach stems from the software's academic origins and our commitment to supporting research.</p>
<p>For commercial users, licenses can be either annual or perpetual (one-time payment). We also offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintenance and support plans ($2,500/year for priority academic support)</li>
<li>Training (online or on-site)</li>
<li>Image analysis services</li>
<li>Viz Server product for remote multi-user access</li>
</ul>
<h2>Training Overview [00:07:24]</h2>
<p>This training series will cover:</p>
<ol>
<li>Basics: loading data, workspace orientation, tools, 2D/3D viewing, shortcuts</li>
<li>Correlative imaging: overlapping and optimizing multiple images</li>
<li>Porosity analysis: segmentation tools and object analysis</li>
<li>Fiber analysis: separating touching objects using watershed tools</li>
<li>Measures: alignment and deviation analysis</li>
<li>Vector fields: visualizing sample directionality</li>
<li>Deep learning tools:</li>
<li>Noise2Void for denoising</li>
<li>Machine learning segmentation with sparse data</li>
<li>Segmentation wizard</li>
<li>Various deep learning applications</li>
</ol>
<h2>Terminology [00:10:12]</h2>
<p>Dragonfly uses specific terminology that might be unfamiliar if you're coming from a different software background:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Images, ROIs (Region of Interest), and Multi-ROIs</strong>: These are structured grids represented by a grid in 3D space</li>
<li><strong>Meshes</strong>: Triangular elements in 3D space representing surfaces, separate from structured grids</li>
<li><strong>Windows Leveling</strong>: The term used for contrast adjustment (terminology from medical imaging origins)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important to understand that meshes and images are completely separate in Dragonfly. If you move or translate image data, you can instruct the associated mesh to follow the same transformation by right-clicking and selecting the appropriate option.</p>
<h2>Basic Shortcuts [00:12:02]</h2>
<p>Essential mouse shortcuts to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pan/Move</strong>: Press both left and right mouse buttons simultaneously while dragging (works in both 2D and 3D windows)</li>
<li><strong>Zoom</strong>: Press down the mouse wheel and drag forward/backward</li>
<li><strong>Contrast adjustment</strong>: Hold the Control key and use the right mouse button while dragging</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We encourage you to get in touch if you have specific questions or would like to see particular demonstrations. We will continue to create short how-to videos to help streamline your workflows and explain new functionality as the software evolves. Please send us your data and specific questions for future demonstrations.</p>
