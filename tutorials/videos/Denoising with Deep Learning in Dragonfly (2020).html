    <h2>Introduction to Deep Learning Denoising</h2>
    <p>This session focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for scientific image denoising. Deep learning requires an NVIDIA CUDA-enabled graphics card. The presenter utilizes a high-performance workstation for deep learning tasks.</p>
    <h2>Neural Network Model Construction</h2>
    <p>The core concept involves training a neural network to transform noisy input images into low-noise output images. The training paradigm involves pairing inputs with outputs, specifically pairing "cheap" (high-noise) images with "expensive" (low-noise) images.</p>
    <h2>Three Deep Learning Denoising Methods</h2>
    <p>There are three deep learning denoising methods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>High-Noise to Low-Noise: Pairing high-noise images with corresponding low-noise images.</li>
      <li>Autoencoder (High-Noise to High-Noise): Training the network to reconstruct high-noise images from themselves.</li>
      <li>Noise to Noise: Training the network to transform one noisy image into another independent noisy version.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Practical Demonstration in Dragonfly</h2>
    <p>The video demonstrates how to set up and train a denoising model using deep learning tools within Dragonfly. It also briefly covers the concept of transferable models and the Infinite Toolbox.</p>
    <h2>Comparison of Denoising Results</h2>
    <p>The video compares deep learning-based denoising results with traditional image filtering methods. Deep learning can preserve more texture and features than some smoothing filters.</p>
    <h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <p>The presenter announces an upcoming workshop on image processing techniques. A Q&A session is also held, discussing various questions related to denoising, deep learning, and Dragonfly.</p>
