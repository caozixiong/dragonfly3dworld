        <h1>Three-Dimensional Visualization of Bone Tissue Vascular and Cellular Spaces - (English)</h1>
        <p>Mary, a postdoctoral researcher at Ohio State University's Injury Biomechanics Research Center, discusses three-dimensional visualization of bone tissue vascular and cellular spaces to understand how bone microstructure changes with mechanical loading and aging, providing insights into bone health and fragility.</p>

            <h2>Tutorial Content</h2>
            <h2>Introduction to Three-Dimensional Visualization of Bone Tissue [00:01:01]</h2>
<p>This tutorial explores methods for visualizing spaces within bone tissue and what they can tell us about bone health. Bone health is studied in the context of human variation, looking at not only biology and genetics, but also the intersection with environment and behavior over the lifespan.</p>
<p>The focus is on skeletal biology, examining finer-grained bone structure as a combination of:<br />
- Physiology<br />
- Mechanical adaptation<br />
- Functional anatomy at the bone tissue level</p>
<p>This approach is relevant for understanding:<br />
- Bone loss and bone fragility<br />
- Targeting vulnerable populations who may be more susceptible to bone loss due to age or pathology<br />
- Identifying at-risk tissue sites<br />
- Determining optimal timing for interventions</p>
<h2>Understanding Bone Quality and Adaptation [00:03:39]</h2>
<p>Bone is affected by two primary factors:<br />
- Mechanical adaptation<br />
- Physiological modification</p>
<p>The cells embedded in bone tissue sense mechanical demand (strain changes and damage). These osteocytes trigger:<br />
- Removal of bone through osteoclasts<br />
- Formation of bone through osteoblasts</p>
<p>This process occurs in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Modeling</strong>:</li>
<li>Under high strain, bone will add material (apposition) externally until it returns to deforming at its customary level</li>
<li>Under low strain, bone will be removed (resorption), primarily internally at the marrow cavity</li>
<li>
<p>Can involve drift or movement of the bone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remodeling</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Occurs within the cortical bone itself</li>
<li>Replaces old or damaged bone</li>
<li>Forms through a "cutting cone" where osteoclasts tunnel and remove bone</li>
<li>Osteoblasts follow and fill in with new bone</li>
<li>Requires blood vessels for nutrient transport to osteocytes</li>
<li>Can be triggered by:<ul>
<li>Damage to the bone (targeted remodeling under high strain)</li>
<li>"Disuse mode remodeling" under low strain</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Age-Associated Bone Loss [00:06:41]</h2>
<p>Bone loss begins earlier than most people realize:<br />
- Bone resorption begins to outpace formation as early as your 20s for trabecular bone<br />
- In your 30s for cortical bone</p>
<p>In the United States, osteoporosis is very pervasive:<br />
- Adults over 50 are clinically diagnosed with low bone mass (osteopenia) or osteoporosis at high rates<br />
- Higher incidence in females due to perimenopausal loss of estrogen (a sex steroid that preserves bone)</p>
<p>Current clinical evaluation uses DEXA scans, but these are under-predictive of fracture risk:<br />
- ABMD (Areal Bone Mineral Density) declines between age 60-80 only account for 2x of the overall 13x increase in fracture risk<br />
- About 54% of people who have hip fractures are not diagnosed as osteoporotic</p>
<h2>Bone Tissue Microstructure and Quality [00:09:11]</h2>
<p>Bone tissue microstructure collaborates in a hierarchical system to support bone strength. Different ways to quantify bone tissue quality include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross-sectional geometry</strong>: The area and distribution of the bone shell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cortical pores</strong>: Required for nutrient transport, visible in both 2D and 3D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secondary osteons</strong>: Surround the cortical pores</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Osteocyte lacunae canalicular networks</strong>: Mechanosensory bone cells within their own pore networks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Microdamage</strong>: Microscopic cracks that allow diffusion of damage and repair without full fracture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trabecular architecture</strong>: Changes in the cancellous bone within the marrow cavity</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Changes in bone quality with age that increase fragility include:<br />
- Decrease in cortical thickness<br />
- Deterioration of trabecular architecture<br />
- Decline in osteocyte lacunae canalicular network<br />
- Increase in cortical porosity<br />
- More microdamage<br />
- Greater collagen and mineral brittleness</p>
<h2>3D Imaging Methods for Bone Visualization [00:10:59]</h2>
<p>Several imaging methods can be used to visualize bone structures:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>CT and Micro CT</strong>:</li>
<li>Traditional CT scans used for injuries</li>
<li>Micro CT provides much higher resolution</li>
<li>
<p>Trade-off between field of view and resolution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Synchrotron Radiation Micro CT</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Accelerates electrons to produce high-intensity X-rays</li>
<li>Provides higher resolution than conventional micro CT</li>
<li>
<p>Allows visualization of smaller structures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Type of fluorescence that blocks out-of-focus light</li>
<li>Provides precise resolution in x, y, and z planes</li>
<li>Limited depth penetration in bone (approximately 100 microns)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Femoral Neck Segmentation Project [00:13:17]</h2>
<p>This project examined how mechanical loading history affects bone microstructure, using Dragonfly for visualization and processing.</p>
<h3>Why Mechanical Loading History Matters:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Microstructure is a record of how tissue was loaded and how it responded</li>
<li>Bone adapts to mechanical demand over the lifespan</li>
<li>Aging and pathology can dysregulate this adaptation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cortical Porosity:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Necessary for bone repair (allows blood vessels to transport nutrients and cells)</li>
<li>In normal quantities, not damaging to bone</li>
<li>With age-related dysregulation, accumulation of vascular porosity creates stress concentrators</li>
<li>Even small increases in porosity significantly impact fracture risk:</li>
<li>4% increase in porosity leads to 84% increase in crack propagation</li>
<li>76% of age-associated loss of strength in the femur is due to cortical porosity</li>
</ul>
<h3>Methodology Challenges:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remodeling is triggered by both low strain and high strain</li>
<li>Difficult to distinguish between targeted remodeling and disuse mode remodeling</li>
<li>Several studies found no significant differences in percent porosity between bones with different loading mechanisms</li>
<li>Physiological dysregulation by aging is highly individual-specific</li>
</ul>
<h3>Study Design:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Compared right femoral neck (weight-bearing, dynamically loaded) to right fourth rib mid-shaft (comparatively unloaded)</li>
<li>Femoral neck has predictable strain gradient (compression increases from superior to inferior)</li>
<li>Rib loading is more complex, varying by level in the thorax</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technical Process with Dragonfly:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Due to budget constraints, femoral necks were physically cut into three pieces for scanning</li>
<li>Dragonfly was used to:</li>
<li>Load and visualize the grayscale data (approximately 60GB)</li>
<li>Orient the pieces for proper alignment</li>
<li>Visualize in 3D and in multiple axes to ensure proper stack alignment</li>
<li>Adaptive thresholding was applied to isolate small pore structures</li>
<li>Created masks to separate cortical from trabecular bone</li>
<li>Differentiated between cortical and trabecular pores based on distance from marrow cavity</li>
<li>Created regional masks to analyze different quadrants of the femoral neck</li>
</ol>
<h2>Results and Findings [00:23:08]</h2>
<p>The femoral neck region confirmed a structure-strain model where:<br />
- Under lower strain: Disuse mode remodeling results in large, interconnected, obliquely oriented pores<br />
- Under high strain: Targeted, brief, precise remodeling creates small, isolated, longitudinally oriented pores</p>
<p>Age-related dysregulation was observed through:<br />
- Increases in pore density<br />
- Decreases in pore separation (implying pore convergence)<br />
- Pore thickness localized to the superior anterior octant</p>
<p>This is significant because the superior anterior octant is particularly vulnerable to crushing during sideways falls, making individuals with this age-related apposition more vulnerable to fragility fractures.</p>
<p>The rib regions matched the high-strain morphotype in the pleural cortex, but showed:<br />
- Less consistent regional patterning<br />
- More sensitivity to age and cortical thickness</p>
<h2>Conclusion [00:24:28]</h2>
<p>This research demonstrates how 3D visualization of bone tissue can reveal important information about:<br />
- Mechanical loading history<br />
- Age-related changes in bone microstructure<br />
- Potential fracture risk factors</p>
<p>Additional studies using similar methods have shown that certain conditions, such as opioid use, can make bone insensitive to differences in mechanical loading between different bones, resulting in similar morphometry rather than appropriate adaptation for distinct biomechanical purposes.</p>
<p>Advanced imaging techniques combined with appropriate visualization software like Dragonfly allow for detailed analysis of bone microstructure that goes beyond what traditional bone density measurements can reveal, potentially leading to better understanding and treatment of age-related bone fragility.</p>
