  <h1>In Vivo and Specimen Imaging at the Center for Molecular and Genomic Imaging</h1>
  
  <p>This presentation discusses in vivo and specimen imaging techniques at the UC Davis Center for Molecular and Genomic Imaging. The presenter, Doug, a principal research scientist, details the center's work with micro-CT imaging, focusing on two primary applications:</p>
  
  <h2>I. In Vivo Imaging of COVID-19 in Mice</h2>
  
  <p>The research aims to establish an in vivo model for Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as long COVID, using genetically humanized mice. Key aspects include:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><b>Animal Model:</b> Novel genetically modified mice with humanized ACE2, TMPRSS2, and furin genes [00:08:45].</li>
  <li><b>Imaging Technique:</b> Respiratory-gated micro-CT lung imaging [00:11:19].</li>
   <li><b>Image Analysis:</b> Deep learning model using a 3D Unet architecture for lung segmentation [00:13:46].</li>
   <li><b>Deep Learning Parameters:</b>
    <ul>
     <li><b>Model:</b> 3D Unet [00:13:46]</li>
     <li><b>Data Augmentation:</b> Utilized [00:13:46]</li>
     <li><b>Image Mask Size:</b> Specified [00:13:53]</li>
     <li><b>Training Data:</b> Six training sets at both end-expiration and inspiration [00:14:11]</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  <li><b>Observed Results:</b> Initial findings indicate decreased lung volume in infected animals at day five post-infection [00:16:28].</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>II. Specimen Imaging of Orchid Bee Brains</h2>
  
  <p>This section focuses on the use of micro-CT for studying sexual dimorphism in the brains of neotropical orchid bees. Key details:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><b>Research Focus:</b> Investigating anatomical differences in bee brains to understand behavioral diversity between male and female bees [00:19:13].</li>
  <li><b>Imaging Technique:</b> Micro-CT imaging with iodine and ethanol staining for contrast enhancement [00:20:41].</li>
  <li><b>Image Analysis:</b> Manual segmentation of nine brain regions [00:20:57].</li>
  <li><b>Findings:</b>
   <ul>
    <li>Male bees show enlargement in brain regions related to visualization [00:23:21].</li>
    <li>Female bees exhibit enlargement in brain regions associated with learning and memory [00:23:37].</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
