        <h1>Automation of NDT Inspection by Dragonfly Scripting and HPC Batch Processing - (English)</h1>
        <p>This presentation showcases how Sandia National Laboratory uses Dragonfly software for automated CT scan analysis of explosive tools and components, implementing Python-based headless processing on a Linux cluster to enable reproducible, high-throughput inspections with CAD-to-scan comparisons that support critical decision-making at scale.</p>

            <h2>Tutorial Content</h2>
            <h2>Introduction to Dragonfly at Sandia National Labs [00:00:25]</h2>
<p>Sandia National Labs has been using Dragonfly software for several years. The team first encountered Dragonfly at a Tosca conference workshop in Gainesville, Florida around 2018-2019, where participants were introduced to deep learning using Amazon Cloud. John Corbin, who had both a Sandia appointment and a graduate student position at the time, recognized Dragonfly's potential and brought it back to Sandia, where they now use it in innovative ways.</p>
<h2>About Sandia National Labs [00:02:13]</h2>
<p>Sandia National Labs is the nation's engineering lab, working alongside Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos on weapons-related work. Due to the sensitive nature of their work, the examples presented are generic, though the same techniques are applied to more critical projects.</p>
<p>The team is part of the Thunder CT lab, which has been given a unique role where customers trust them to explore and innovate. They have permission to fail, which is rare in industry, allowing them to push boundaries and experiment with new approaches.</p>
<p>Their primary focus is examining explosive tools - devices that serve a useful purpose but are consumed when tested. The challenge is to digitize these items so they can be examined internally, identify defects, determine their significance, and evaluate whether they meet performance criteria before either deploying them or disposing of them.</p>
<h2>Why Dragonfly for High-Consequence Work [00:04:11]</h2>
<p>The team turned to Dragonfly because it was the only way to effectively script their processes and create scalable solutions. Scale is critical because they sometimes need to perform hundreds of evaluations per week. Every decision they make has life-altering consequences, so each step must be perfect.</p>
<p>By automating their workflows, they can address multiple problems simultaneously and deliver quick results. The complexity of their setup allows them to serve different "customers" in the process:<br />
- CT technologists who need to quickly verify scan quality<br />
- People tracking orders who need status updates<br />
- Analysts who need detailed information</p>
<p>Automation allows them to extract data at every step and deliver the right information to the appropriate people.</p>
<h2>Hardware Infrastructure [00:07:18]</h2>
<p>The team uses a Linux cluster that is PXE-booted for easy scaling. Key hardware specifications include:<br />
- RTX 6000 GPUs<br />
- Half a terabyte of RAM per node<br />
- Multiple x86 cores<br />
- Several petabytes of storage</p>
<p>Interestingly, some of the original nodes in their cluster were borrowed from a supercomputer at Sandia that was being retired. The system is housed in a remote location with no monitors attached - all processing is done headless, using Python scripts that import the Dragonfly Python environment.</p>
<h2>Dragonfly Workflows [00:08:49]</h2>
<p>The team uses Dragonfly for several key processes in their inspection workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generating media for quick visualization</li>
<li>Global geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&amp;T)</li>
<li>Comparing ideal CAD models to as-built objects</li>
</ol>
<h3>Data Organization and Quick Visualization [00:10:17]</h3>
<p>To organize and quickly search their data, the team created a webpage where each scan is represented with quick visualizations:<br />
- Clayhe filters (essentially edge detectors) to highlight anomalies<br />
- Videos that rotate through different slices of the data</p>
<p>This approach helps the team coordinate when processing large orders and assists with debugging issues like detector problems or scan quality concerns.</p>
<h3>Rough Segmentation with Recursive OTSU [00:11:31]</h3>
<p>The team uses recursive OTSU splits on scans to quickly generate rough segmentations of different materials. This approach provides a reproducible way to label different materials in scans, even when CT machine calibration shifts over time.</p>
<p>As John explained, they're not just doing local OTSU but performing more sophisticated space splitting operations that are reproducible and provide meaningful information. This rough segmentation is important for the next steps in their process.</p>
<h3>CAD Alignment and Comparison [00:13:45]</h3>
<p>Once they have the rough segmentation, they can match parts of the scan to a CAD description. This process involves:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rough Alignment</strong>: Getting CAD components in the approximate location</li>
<li><strong>Fine Alignment</strong>: Using synthetic CTs generated around a neighborhood to perform volume-to-volume matching</li>
</ol>
<p>The fine alignment is essentially an image registration process that allows them to see where the actual materials are located versus where they were expected to be. This provides a simple vector that describes how the as-built part shifted with respect to the design part.</p>
<p>For example, they can detect that a screw is backed out slightly or identify components that were present in the scan but missing from the CAD (like a pen clip that wasn't included in the design files).</p>
<h3>ML-Based Segmentation and Analysis [00:16:45]</h3>
<p>After alignment, they can perform high-quality machine learning segmentation. Thanks to Dragonfly's structure, they can extract DICOM data for each material and directly use it in their code, or export meshes for finite element analysis.</p>
<p>The team is also working on using Dragonfly to track processes running on their HPC systems, ensuring everything runs smoothly in the background.</p>
<h2>Conclusion [00:17:58]</h2>
<p>Dragonfly has become integral to Sandia's workflow. The ability to access and control everything through Python while leveraging Dragonfly's suite of tools is critical for solving problems at scale.</p>
<p>The team uses Dragonfly differently than most users - rather than working interactively on the desktop, they're writing code and routines that follow algorithmic processes while leveraging Dragonfly's data structures. Their fully automated solutions perform analyses and then write to ORS session files, which can later be opened in interactive Dragonfly sessions for human review.</p>
<p>This approach provides both automation and human interpretability, allowing them to document all steps in a way that can be easily understood and verified by others. The flexibility of their geometric dimensioning and tolerance approach is particularly impressive, with each component being locally fit to identify defects and displacements at both the individual part and global levels.</p>
