  <h1>Three-Dimensional Visualization of Bone Tissue Vascular and Cellular Spaces</h1>
  <p>Presentation by Mary from The Ohio State University, discussing the use of Dragonfly for visualizing bone tissue.</p>
 

  <h2>Key Topics:</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Introduction to Bone Quality</b>: Bone quality is affected by mechanical adaptation and physiological modification [00:03:40].</li>
  <li><b>Bone Remodeling</b>: Bone adapts to mechanical demand via osteocytes, triggering bone removal (osteoclasts) or formation (osteoblasts) [00:03:49].</li>
  <li><b>Modeling vs. Remodeling</b>:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Modeling</b>: Separate removal or formation of bone [00:04:15].</li>
  <li><b>Remodeling</b>: Activity within cortical bone, replacing old or damaged bone [00:05:25].</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Age-Associated Bone Loss</b>: Bone resorption outpaces formation, starting as early as the 20s (trabecular) and 30s (cortical) [00:06:42].</li>
  <li><b>Clinical Evaluation</b>: DEXA scans are used, but under-predict fracture risk [00:07:54].</li>
  <li><b>Bone Microstructure</b>: Hierarchical system supporting bone strength, including cross-sectional geometry, trabecular bone, porosity, osteons, and more [00:08:42].</li>
  <li><b>3D Imaging Methods</b>:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Micro-CT</b>: High-resolution imaging [00:11:01].</li>
  <li><b>Synchrotron Radiation Micro-CT</b>: Sub-micron resolution, performed at specialized facilities [00:11:37].</li>
  <li><b>Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy</b>: Precise resolution in X, Y, and Z planes, but limited depth [00:12:18].</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Project 1: Mechanical Loading History</b>:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Goal</b>: To determine if pores produced by high strain targeted remodeling are morphologically different from pores produced by lower strain disuse mode remodeling [00:15:54].</li>
  <li><b>Methodology</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Compared femoral neck (weight-bearing) to rib (unloaded) in human subjects [00:16:09].</li>
  <li>Micro-CT scans at 6.4 .097 microns [00:18:27].</li>
  <li>Used Dragonfly for reassembling cut femoral neck sections [00:19:24].</li>
  <li>Adaptive thresholding to isolate pore structures [00:20:10].</li>
  <li>3D morphometry in CT analyzer [00:22:26].</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Findings</b>: Pore morphology varies with strain; dysregulated with age [00:22:56].</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Project 2: Opioid-Driven Bone Loss</b>: Used a rabbit model to visualize bone changes due to opioid use [00:24:38].</li>
  </ul>
 

  <h2>Technical Details:</h2>
  <ol>
  <li><b>Image Acquisition</b>: Micro-CT scans were performed at varying resolutions, including sub-micron resolution using synchrotron radiation [00:11:01], [00:11:37].</li>
  <li><b>Software Used</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>Dragonfly: For 3D visualization and orientation of image stacks [00:19:24].</li>
  <li>ImageJ/Fiji: For developing macros (e.g., Pore Extractor 3D) and image processing [00:18:50].</li>
  <li>CT Analyzer: For morphometry analysis [00:19:03], [00:22:26].</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Segmentation Techniques</b>: Morphological smoothing and binary operations were used [00:13:09]. Adaptive thresholding was employed to isolate pore structures [00:20:10].</li>
  <li><b>Data Analysis</b>: 3D morphometry was conducted using CT Analyzer [00:22:26].</li>
  </ol>
