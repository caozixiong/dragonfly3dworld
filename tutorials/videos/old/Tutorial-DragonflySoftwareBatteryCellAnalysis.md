---- Tutorial Content Start ----
## I. Initial Data Visualization and Orientation

Start by loading your battery cell data in Dragonfly 2024.1. If the data doesn't automatically display in quad view, you can adjust this in the layout panel [00:00:37].

To better examine specific views:

- Double-click on any view to maximize or minimize it
- Use the flip tool to properly orient the cell upright [00:01:16]
- Apply the clipping box tool to virtually cut open the data, allowing you to inspect internal structures such as anodes, cathodes, and the metal casing [00:02:11]

## II. Manual Inspection and Annotation

For detailed examination:

- Double-click on 2D cross-sectional views to make measurements and identify key components (anodes, cathodes, spacer materials) [00:03:08]
- Create oblique views by using your mouse near the crosshairs, enabling circumferential inspection of the battery [00:04:36]
- Mark defects using the "Points" tool with Ctrl+click, and export these annotations with their precise XYZ locations to a CSV file [00:06:01]

## III. Manual Measurements

For precise measurements:

- Access the ruler tool from the annotation panel to measure overhang heights [00:09:54]
- Fine-tune your measurements by zooming in and switching to nearest interpolation mode to view individual pixels [00:10:21]
- Use floating captions to position your measurements clearly in the view
- Export both screenshots and ruler data (including lengths and XYZ locations) to CSV files [00:11:11]

## IV. Automated Analysis with Deep Learning

For more efficient analysis:

- Apply a pre-trained deep learning model to automatically segment overhang regions adjacent to cathodes [00:13:55]
- Export the segmentation as an ROI, then as a multi-ROI to compute measurements such as 2D major axis length [00:15:08]

## V. Training a Custom Deep Learning Model

To create your own specialized model:

- Launch the segmentation wizard to train a custom model
- Define your classes (e.g., cathode, background, anode overhang) [00:17:05]
- Add multiple frames, marking different regions of the sample:
    - Use a "mixed" frame for both training and validation
    - Add another frame for monitoring [00:17:41]
- Start the training process:
    - Select a pre-trained model for faster results
    - Monitor the loss values and preview the segmentation results [00:21:42]
- Enhance your model by:
    - Adding more training data or adjusting existing annotations if the model doesn't converge as expected [00:25:35]
    - Saving your trained model via the model tab or when exiting the wizard, making it available for future use in Dragonfly [00:36:31]
