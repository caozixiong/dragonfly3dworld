---- Tutorial Content Start ----
## Accessing Example Data [00:06:25]

1. Navigate to the Digital Rocks Portal to access publicly available datasets
2. Available datasets include TIF stacks, Aviso mesh data, and raw data

## Importing Images

### Importing a TIF Stack [00:08:15]

1. Go to File > Import Image Files
2. Click "Add" and navigate to the folder containing your TIF images
3. Select all TIF files and click "Open"
4. Input the correct pixel size (e.g., 54.1 microns per pixel) [00:09:46]
5. Click "Finish"

### Importing Raw Data [00:18:18]

1. Go to File > Import Image Files
2. Click "Add" and select the raw file
3. Specify the dimensions (e.g., 1024x1024x800) and data type (e.g., 8-bit) [00:19:05]
4. Input the correct pixel size [00:19:29]
5. Click "Finish"

### Importing an A.M. File [00:24:21]

1. Go to File > Import Images
2. Select the A.M. file
3. Set the pixel size [00:24:53]
4. Click Finish

## Visualizing and Manipulating Image Data [00:10:19]

1. **View Layout**:
    - Use the layout panel to switch to a multi-view layout for orthogonal and 3D views [00:11:15]
    - Manipulate crosshairs to view specific areas in different views [00:11:48]
    - Double-click a view to make it fullscreen [00:12:21]
2. **Navigation Controls**:
    - Zoom: Use the scroll wheel (depress and drag) or adjust the field of view [00:12:36]
    - Pan: Press and drag with both mouse buttons [00:13:24]
3. **Pixel Inspection** [00:13:45]:
    - Zoom in to see individual pixels by disabling interpolation in the 2D settings [00:13:57]
    - Use the probe tool to check pixel intensity and coordinates [00:14:36]
4. **Brightness and Contrast** [00:20:10]:
    - Use the Window Leveling panel to adjust brightness and contrast [00:20:17]
    - Manipulate the histogram to set the window for mapping brightness [00:20:35]
    - Alternatively, drag up/down for brightness and left/right for contrast directly on the image [00:21:51]

## Saving Your Work [00:22:47]

1. Right-click the data and select Export > As ORS Object
2. Save the data in Dragonfly's native format to preserve pixel size and other metadata

## Additional Information [00:26:27]

The Q&A section covers various topics including:

- Music and video availability
- Graphics card requirements
- MRC file handling
- Window leveling techniques
- Video downloads
- Multi-channel image processing
- Fixing upside-down images
- Dragonfly's key strengths

The webinar concludes by highlighting Dragonfly's flexibility, extensibility, and powerful image segmentation tools [00:33:03].
