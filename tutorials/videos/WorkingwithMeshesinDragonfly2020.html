  <h1>Dragonfly Daily 02: Working with Meshes in Dragonfly (2020) - Summary and Tutorial</h1>
 

  <section>
  <h2>Video Overview</h2>
  <p>This video, presented by Mike Marsh, Product Manager for Dragonfly, serves as Lesson 2 in a series focused on the Dragonfly scientific imaging application. It provides an introduction to working with meshes within the Dragonfly environment. The lesson covers mesh rendering, generation, importing, visualization, and saving.</p>

  <h2>Step-by-Step Tutorial: Working with Meshes in Dragonfly</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>
  <h3>Downloading a Sample Mesh Data Set [00:02:26]</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Navigate to the MorphoSource repository to acquire scientific imaging and mesh data.</li>
  <li>Search for the identifier "MorphoSource 104845" to locate the specific mandible data set used in the video.</li>
  <li>Create an account and log in to MorphoSource to download the data set, which is provided under a Creative Commons license by the National Museum of Natural History.</li>
  <li>The downloaded file will be in a ZIP archive; extract the contents to access the .PLY mesh file.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3>Importing and Visualizing a Mesh File [00:04:33]</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Open Dragonfly and navigate to <strong>File > Import Mesh Files</strong>.</li>
  <li>Browse to the location of the downloaded .PLY file and import it.</li>
  <li>Note that the initial display shows the mesh as an outline.</li>
  <li>To view the mesh in 3D, adjust the layout to a 3D or multi-view configuration.</li>
  <li>Explore the <strong>Mesh Property</strong> panels to toggle between solid, outlined, and wireframe renderings [00:06:08].</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3>Generating a Contour Mesh from Image Data [00:07:09]</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Load an image data set into Dragonfly (e.g., "fracture in Granite").</li>
  <li>Right-click on the image data set and select <strong>Generate Contour Mesh</strong> [00:07:49].</li>
  <li>Accept the default settings and export the contour as a mesh.</li>
  <li>The resulting mesh represents the interface within the image data.</li>
  <li>Adjust the mesh's color and transparency via the color tile in the properties panel [00:08:49].</li>
  <li>Apply smoothing to the mesh to refine its surface [00:09:00].</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3>Importing Additional Mesh Files [00:09:29]</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Download a mesh file from a public repository such as Thingiverse (e.g., "floppy dragonfly").</li>
  <li>Import the downloaded .STL file into Dragonfly using <strong>File > Import Mesh Files</strong> [00:10:15].</li>
  <li>Customize the appearance of the imported mesh by adjusting color and transparency.</li>
  <li>Utilize the 3D visualization tools within Dragonfly to manipulate the view, lighting, and shadowing.</li>
  <li>Experiment with "eye candy" features like depth of field for enhanced rendering [00:11:03].</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3>Visualizing Data on a Mesh [00:12:06]</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Import a mesh file that contains encoded data (available from the ORS Dragonfly sample data sets).</li>
  <li>Right-click on the mesh and select <strong>Measurement Inspector</strong> [00:12:41].</li>
  <li>Choose a measurement to visualize (e.g., volume or surface area).</li>
  <li>Adjust the color map and range to effectively display the data distribution on the mesh.</li>
  <li>Use transparency settings to highlight specific data ranges [00:13:35].</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3>Saving a Mesh [00:14:34]</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>To save a mesh, right-click on it and choose <strong>Export as ORS Object</strong>.</li>
  <li>This will preserve all associated data, such as measurements encoded on the vertices.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Additional Topics Covered</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Discussion of ISO contouring for mesh generation [00:15:17].</li>
  <li>Explanation of data inversion and flipping [00:16:21].</li>
  <li>Considerations for slice distance in FIB-SEM data [00:17:44].</li>
  <li>Capabilities for handling floating-point image data [00:19:02].</li>
  <li>Limitations regarding solid meshing tools [00:19:24].</li>
  </ul>
  </section>
